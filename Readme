BreadcrumbsNextJS-Fetch-GoogleSheet
This project provides a simple way to fetch data from a Google Sheet and display it on a Next.js application. Using Google Sheets as a CMS, you can dynamically update the content of your website without needing to redeploy your application. The data is fetched using the Google Sheets API, processed in Next.js, and displayed in a breadcrumb-style navigation UI.

Features
Google Sheets Integration: Fetch data directly from Google Sheets using the Sheets API.
Next.js: Server-side rendering for fast and dynamic content updates.
Breadcrumbs Navigation: Display hierarchical data in a breadcrumb format.
API Fetching: Uses Next.js API routes to fetch data from the Google Sheets API.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following:

Node.js installed on your machine.
A Google Cloud project with the Sheets API enabled.
Access to a Google Sheet (with public or authenticated access).
Google API credentials (OAuth2 or API key).
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BreadcrumbsNextJS-Fetch-GoogleSheet.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copiar código
cd BreadcrumbsNextJS-Fetch-GoogleSheet
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copiar código
npm install
Configure Google Sheets API Credentials:

Obtain your credentials from the Google Cloud Console and add them to an .env.local file in the project root.
Example .env.local file:

bash
Copiar código
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-google-sheet-id
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
Usage
Fetching Data: The data is fetched from a Google Sheet using an API route in Next.js. You can configure the GOOGLE_SHEET_ID and API endpoint to target your specific sheet.

Start the Development Server:

bash
Copiar código
npm run dev
Your application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Displaying Data in Breadcrumb Format: The app fetches data and dynamically builds a breadcrumb-style navigation UI. Customize the data parsing logic as needed based on your sheet’s structure.

Project Structure
/pages/index.js: The homepage of your Next.js app.
/pages/api/fetchSheet.js: The API route used to fetch data from the Google Sheet.
/components/Breadcrumb.js: The breadcrumb component that renders the fetched data hierarchically.
/utils/sheetAPI.js: Contains utility functions for fetching and parsing Google Sheet data.
Deployment
Build for Production:

bash
Copiar código
npm run build
Run the Production Server:

bash
Copiar código
npm start
Deploy to Vercel:
This Next.js app can easily be deployed to Vercel. Simply connect your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically handle the deployment.

Troubleshooting
API Authentication Errors: Ensure that your .env.local contains the correct API key or OAuth credentials.
Google Sheets Permissions: Make sure your Google Sheet is accessible (either public or shared with the appropriate credentials).
404 Errors for Breadcrumb Data: Check the structure of your Google Sheet and ensure the correct parsing logic is implemented in sheetAPI.js.
